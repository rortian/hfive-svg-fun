This is my experiment with svg in html5.  I started with circle.svg and was able to 
get it showing in IE9, FF4, and Chrome (but not Opera).

I'm working on making scratch.html building up circle.html dynamically.

shows what you need to get svg working

The original (made using inkscape) used curved line commands (C), now it is using the much more efficient (in this case) ellipse commands (a).
